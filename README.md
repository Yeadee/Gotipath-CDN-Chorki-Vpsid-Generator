# Gotipath CDN (Chorki) Vpsid Generator Script
This script will generate vpsid with automated start and end time for seamless playback of protected streams on Chorki. The protection scheme uses a simple SHA1 protection which depends solely on the secret key. This repo is for educational purpose only, so the key will not be disclosed. Enjoy.
Cheers!
